# TypingTestCheat
PURELY EDUCATIONAL repository that proves some typing test applications I have used can be cheated on

# I DO NOT ENDORSE THE USE OF THIS SCRIPT FOR ACTUAL CHEATING, IT IS PURELY AVAILABLE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!

Written for: Python 3.8

Definitely supports (as of 20/07/2020): the Discord bot Miso

Will I add support for more typing tests?

Maybe when I'm bored ;). Also, if you want to analyse image based typing tests, consider using an OCR service.
